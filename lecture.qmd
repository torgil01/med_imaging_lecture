## Neccesary libraries

In this lecture we will only use two extra libraries 

*  `nibabel` for reading and writing images
*  `numpy` for math operations 


## Installing libraries

It is good practice to install packages in a specific environment. This will avoid conflicts with other packages.

Here we will use python venv to set up a virtual environment.

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

mkdir .venv   # create folder where we will store the venv
python -m venv .venv/nii # create venv called "nii" 
source .venv/nii/bin/activate # activate nii environment
```

Notice that the `nii` environment is now active. You can see that it is active since the promte is changed to `(nii)`.

Now we can install the libraries

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

pip install nibabel
pip install numpy
```

These libraris will only be available when the `nii` environment is active.
